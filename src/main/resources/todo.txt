TODO:
    Make Discoverable waygates spawn at villages sometimes (configurable)
    Add cooldowns for use (configurable, mostly small)
    Add "Warpstone" item with bow animation that can open your waygates from anywhere
        Increased cost for travel?
        Cost to open?
    Make teleports not instant & cancel if you take damage
        Maybe only from the warpstone item?
        Maybe very short on waygates, and longer on warpstone?
        Maybe time depends (logarithmically) on distance? So max 5 seconds, but instant within render distance?
    Add cost system:
        Cost can be based on:
            Distance
            Crossing worlds
            Target chunk loaded
        Costs can be:
            Items
            XP
            Currency
    Add some kind of "tier" or "attribute" system that controls if waygates are visible cross-world, or when unloaded
        Currently, known waygates are always visible even in unloaded chunks
    Add simpler particle configuration
    Make titles have better timings for fading in & out
    Add limitations like distance that can be extended using a different block like a repeater
